# Typescript

Typescript is an open source language and is a superset of JavaScript.

## Benefits of using TypeScript

- Offers additional features to JavaScript including static types
- Using types is completely optional
- Compiles down to regular JavaScript
- Can be used for front-end JS as well as backend with Node.js
- Includes most features from ES6, ES7 (classes, arrow functions, etc.)
- Types from 3rd party libraries can be added with type definitions

## Dynamic vs Static Typing

```
In Dynamically typed languages, the types are associated with run-time values and not named explicitly in your code.
```

```
In Statically typed languages, you explicitly assign types to variables, function parameters, return values, etc.
```

- Static language examples: Java, C, C++, GO
- Dynamic Examples: JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP

## Pros & Cons

- Popular

### Cons

- More code to write
- More to learn
- Required Compilation
- Not true static typing
